**Arcadian** is a wolf that evolves — always ahead of the pack and the leader.

This tool is designed to test the efficacy of the AW tool stack and ensure we remain leaders in the EDR marketplace.

## Key Features

- **Portable**: Easy to download and run without requiring terminal interaction.
- **Customizable**: Simple to configure and tailor for different testing scenarios.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for smooth demos with clear output and easy pivoting.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Tests a wide variety of our EDR technologies within a single application — including memory control, behavioral detections, and protection agents — eliminating the need to jump between multiple tools.

## Built On PurpleSharp

Arcadian is built on top of PurpleSharp (not a competitor), enabling effective testing of shellcode without relying on external tools to run malicious commands. This approach is superior for testing the efficacy of LOLBINS by calling native Win32 functions and can be seamlessly integrated into your threat simulation story.
